          <h3># Meet Laravel</h3>
          <p class="contenido">
            Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant
            syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point for
            creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating
            something amazing while we sweat the details.
          </p>

          <p class="contenido">
            Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience, while
            providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection,
            an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs,
            unit and integration testing, and more.
          </p>

          <p class="contenido">
            Whether you are new to PHP or web frameworks or have years of
            experience, Laravel is a framework that can grow with you. We'll
            help you take your first steps as a web developer or give you a
            boost as you take your expertise to the next level. We can't wait to
            see what you build.
          </p>

          <h3># Why Laravel?</h3>

          <p class="contenido">
            There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when
            building a web application. However, we believe Laravel is the best
            choice for building modern, full-stack web applications.
          </p>

          <h5>A Progressive Framework</h5>

          <p class="contenido">
            We like to call Laravel a "progressive" framework. By that, we mean
            that Laravel grows with you. If you're just taking your first steps
            into web development, Laravel's vast library of documentation,
            guides, and video tutorials will help you learn the ropes without
            becoming overwhelmed.
          </p>

          <p class="contenido">
            If you're a senior developer, Laravel gives you robust tools for
            dependency injection, unit testing, queues, real-time events, and
            more. Laravel is fine-tuned for building professional web
            applications and ready to handle enterprise work loads.
          </p>

          <h5>Getting Started On macOS</h5>

          <p class="contenido">
            If you're developing on a Mac and Docker Desktop is already
            installed, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new
            Laravel project. For example, to create a new Laravel application in
            a directory named "example-app", you may run the following command
            in your terminal:
          </p>

          <code> curl -s "https://laravel.build/example-app" | bash </code>

          <p class="contenido">
            Of course, you can change "example-app" in this URL to anything you
            like. The Laravel application's directory will be created within the
            directory you execute the command from.
          </p>

          <p class="contenido">
            After the project has been created, you can navigate to the
            application directory and start Laravel Sail. Laravel Sail provides
            a simple command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's
            default Docker configuration:
          </p>

          <code>
            cd example-app <br />
            ./vendor/bin/sail up
          </code>

          <p class="contenido">
            The first time you run the Sail up command, Sail's application
            containers will be built on your machine. This could take several
            minutes. Don't worry, subsequent attempts to start Sail will be much
            faster.
          </p>

          <p class="contenido">
            Once the application's Docker containers have been started, you can
            access the application in your web browser at: http://localhost.

      <section id="configuration_laravel" class="main-section">
        <header class="title">Configuration</header>
        <article>
          <h3># Introduction</h3>
          <p class="contenido">
            All of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored
            in the config directory. Each option is documented, so feel free to
            look through the files and get familiar with the options available
            to you.
          </p>
          <p class="contenido">
            These configuration files allow you to configure things like your
            database connection information, your mail server information, as
            well as various other core configuration values such as your
            application timezone and encryption key.
          </p>

          <h3># Environment Configuration</h3>

          <p class="contenido">
            It is often helpful to have different configuration values based on
            the environment where the application is running. For example, you
            may wish to use a different cache driver locally than you do on your
            production server.
          </p>

          <p class="contenido">
            To make this a cinch, Laravel utilizes the DotEnv PHP library. In a
            fresh Laravel installation, the root directory of your application
            will contain a .env.example file that defines many common
            environment variables. During the Laravel installation process, this
            file will automatically be copied to .env.
          </p>

          <h5>Available Router Methods</h5>

          <p class="contenido">
            The router allows you to register routes that respond to any HTTP
            verb:
          </p>

          <code>
            Route::get($uri, $callback); <br />
            Route::post($uri, $callback); Route::put($uri, $callback); <br />
            Route::patch($uri, $callback); Route::delete($uri, $callback);
          </code>

        <article>
          <h3># The Root Directory</h3>
          <p class="contenido">
            The app directory contains the core code of your application. We'll
            explore this directory in more detail soon; however, almost all of
            the classes in your application will be in this directory.
          </p>

          <h5>The Bootstrap Directory</h5>

          <p class="contenido">
            The bootstrap directory contains the app.php file which bootstraps
            the framework. This directory also houses a cache directory which
            contains framework generated files for performance optimization such
            as the route and services cache files. You should not typically need
            to modify any files within this directory.
          </p>

          <h3>Laravel Breeze</h3>
          <p class="contenido">
            Laravel Breeze is a minimal, simple implementation of all of
            Laravel's authentication features, including login, registration,
            password reset, email verification, and password confirmation.
            Laravel Breeze's default view layer is made up of simple Blade
            templates styled with Tailwind CSS. Breeze provides a wonderful
            starting point for beginning a fresh Laravel application.
          </p>

          <h5># Installation</h5>

          <p class="contenido">
            First, you should create a new Laravel application, configure your
            database, and run your database migrations:
          </p>

          <code>
            curl -s https://laravel.build/example-app | bash <br />
            cd example-app <br />
            php artisan migrate
          </code>

          <p class="contenido">
            Once you have created a new Laravel application, you may install
            Laravel Breeze using Composer:
          </p>

          <code> composer require laravel/breeze --dev </code>

          <p class="contenido">
            After Composer has installed the Laravel Breeze package, you may run
            the breeze:install Artisan command. This command publishes the
            authentication views, routes, controllers, and other resources to
            your application. Laravel Breeze publishes all of its code to your
            application so that you have full control and visibility over its
            features and implementation. After Breeze is installed, you should
            also compile your assets so that your application's CSS file is
            available:
          </p>

          <code>
            php artisan breeze:install <br />
            npm install <br />
            npm run dev <br />
            php artisan migrate
          </code>

          <p class="contenido">
            Next, you may navigate to your application's /login or /register
            URLs in your web browser. All of Breeze's routes are defined within
            the routes/auth.php file.
          </p>

        <article>
          <h3>Server Requirements</h3>
          <p class="contenido">
            The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. You should
            ensure that your web server has the following minimum PHP version
            and extensions:
          </p>

          <ul class="a">
            <li>PHP >= 7.3</li>
            <li>BCMath PHP Extension</li>
            <li>Ctype PHP Extension</li>
            <li>Fileinfo PHP Extension</li>
            <li>JSON PHP Extension</li>
            <li>Mbstring PHP Extension</li>
            <li>OpenSSL PHP Extension</li>
            <li>PDO PHP Extension</li>
            <li>Tokenizer PHP Extension</li>
            <li>XML PHP Extension</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="contenido">
            If you are deploying your application to a server that is running
            Nginx, you may use the following configuration file as a starting
            point for configuring your web server. Most likely, this file will
            need to be customized depending on your server's configuration. If
            you would like assistance in managing your server, consider using a
            first-party Laravel server management and deployment service such as
            Laravel Forge.
          </p>

          <p class="contenido">
            Please ensure, like the configuration below, your web server directs
            all requests to your application's public/index.php file. You should
            never attempt to move the index.php file to your project's root, as
            serving the application from the project root will expose many
            sensitive configuration files to the public Internet:
          </p>

          <code>
            server { listen 80; server_name example.com; root
            /srv/example.com/public; add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
            add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"; index index.php;
            charset utf-8; location / { try_files $uri $uri/
            /index.php?$query_string; } location = /favicon.ico { access_log
            off; log_not_found off; } location = /robots.txt { access_log off;
            log_not_found off; } error_page 404 /index.php; location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock; fastcgi_param
            SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name; include
            fastcgi_params; } location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* { deny all; } }
          </code>

          <h5># Autoloader Optimization</h5>
          <p class="contenido">
            When deploying to production, make sure that you are optimizing
            Composer's class autoloader map so Composer can quickly find the
            proper file to load for a given class:
          </p>

          <code> composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev </code>

          <ul class="a">
            <li class="section_Deployment">
              use App\Contracts\DowntimeNotifier;
            </li>
            <li class="section_Deployment">
              use App\Contracts\ServerProvider;

          <h5>Basic Routing</h5>
          <p class="contenido">
            The most basic Laravel routes accept a URI and a closure, providing
            a very simple and expressive method of defining routes and behavior
