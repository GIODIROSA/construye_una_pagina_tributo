        <h3># Meet Laravel</h3>
        <p class="contenido">
          Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant
          syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point for
          creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating something
          amazing while we sweat the details.
        </p>

        <p class="contenido">
          Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience, while
          providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection, an
          expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit
          and integration testing, and more.
        </p>

        <p class="contenido">
          Whether you are new to PHP or web frameworks or have years of
          experience, Laravel is a framework that can grow with you. We'll help
          you take your first steps as a web developer or give you a boost as
          you take your expertise to the next level. We can't wait to see what
          you build.
        </p>

        <h3># Why Laravel?</h3>

        <p class="contenido">
          There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when
          building a web application. However, we believe Laravel is the best
          choice for building modern, full-stack web applications.
        </p>

        <h5>A Progressive Framework</h5>

        <p class="contenido">
          We like to call Laravel a "progressive" framework. By that, we mean
          that Laravel grows with you. If you're just taking your first steps
          into web development, Laravel's vast library of documentation, guides,
          and video tutorials will help you learn the ropes without becoming
          overwhelmed.
        </p>

        <p class="contenido">
          If you're a senior developer, Laravel gives you robust tools for
          dependency injection, unit testing, queues, real-time events, and
          more. Laravel is fine-tuned for building professional web applications
          and ready to handle enterprise work loads.

        <header class="title">Configuration</header>
        <h3># Introduction</h3>
        <p class="contenido">
          All of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored in
          the config directory. Each option is documented, so feel free to look
          through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.
        </p>
        <p class="contenido">
          These configuration files allow you to configure things like your
          database connection information, your mail server information, as well
          as various other core configuration values such as your application
          timezone and encryption key.
