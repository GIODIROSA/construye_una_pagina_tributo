          <h3># Meet Laravel</h3>
          <p class="contenido">
            Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant
            syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point for
            creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating
            something amazing while we sweat the details.
          </p>

          <p class="contenido">
            Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience, while
            providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection,
            an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs,
            unit and integration testing, and more.
          </p>

          <p class="contenido">
            Whether you are new to PHP or web frameworks or have years of
            experience, Laravel is a framework that can grow with you. We'll
            help you take your first steps as a web developer or give you a
            boost as you take your expertise to the next level. We can't wait to
            see what you build.
          </p>

          <h3># Why Laravel?</h3>

          <p class="contenido">
            There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when
            building a web application. However, we believe Laravel is the best
            choice for building modern, full-stack web applications.
          </p>

          <h5>A Progressive Framework</h5>

          <p class="contenido">
            We like to call Laravel a "progressive" framework. By that, we mean
            that Laravel grows with you. If you're just taking your first steps
            into web development, Laravel's vast library of documentation,
            guides, and video tutorials will help you learn the ropes without
            becoming overwhelmed.
          </p>

          <p class="contenido">
            If you're a senior developer, Laravel gives you robust tools for
            dependency injection, unit testing, queues, real-time events, and
            more. Laravel is fine-tuned for building professional web
            applications and ready to handle enterprise work loads.
          </p>

          <h5>Getting Started On macOS</h5>

          <p class="contenido">
            If you're developing on a Mac and Docker Desktop is already
            installed, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new
            Laravel project. For example, to create a new Laravel application in
            a directory named "example-app", you may run the following command
            in your terminal:
          </p>

          <code> curl -s "https://laravel.build/example-app" | bash </code>

          <p class="contenido">
            Of course, you can change "example-app" in this URL to anything you
            like. The Laravel application's directory will be created within the
            directory you execute the command from.
          </p>

          <p class="contenido">
            After the project has been created, you can navigate to the
            application directory and start Laravel Sail. Laravel Sail provides
            a simple command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's
            default Docker configuration:
          </p>

          <code>
            cd example-app <br />
            ./vendor/bin/sail up
          </code>

          <p class="contenido">
            The first time you run the Sail up command, Sail's application
            containers will be built on your machine. This could take several
            minutes. Don't worry, subsequent attempts to start Sail will be much
            faster.
          </p>

          <p class="contenido">
            Once the application's Docker containers have been started, you can
            access the application in your web browser at: http://localhost.

        <header class="title">Configuration</header>
        <article>
          <h3># Introduction</h3>
          <p class="contenido">
            All of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored
            in the config directory. Each option is documented, so feel free to
            look through the files and get familiar with the options available
            to you.
          </p>
          <p class="contenido">
            These configuration files allow you to configure things like your
            database connection information, your mail server information, as
            well as various other core configuration values such as your
            application timezone and encryption key.
          </p>

          <h3># Environment Configuration</h3>

          <p class="contenido">
            It is often helpful to have different configuration values based on
            the environment where the application is running. For example, you
            may wish to use a different cache driver locally than you do on your
            production server.
          </p>

          <p class="contenido">
            To make this a cinch, Laravel utilizes the DotEnv PHP library. In a
            fresh Laravel installation, the root directory of your application
            will contain a .env.example file that defines many common
            environment variables. During the Laravel installation process, this
            file will automatically be copied to .env.
          </p>

        <article>
          <h3># The Root Directory</h3>
          <p class="contenido">
            The app directory contains the core code of your application. We'll
            explore this directory in more detail soon; however, almost all of
            the classes in your application will be in this directory.
          </p>

          <h5>The Bootstrap Directory</h5>

          <p class="contenido">
            The bootstrap directory contains the app.php file which bootstraps
            the framework. This directory also houses a cache directory which
            contains framework generated files for performance optimization such
            as the route and services cache files. You should not typically need
            to modify any files within this directory.
